# ClothingAdvisor_App

A mobile application development project called "Clothing Advisor." The application aims to assist people in choosing what to wear daily, based on information from a global database. The application will be developed using React Native technology and will be supported by Firebase.

The main functional requirements of the project include:

1. Three types of user profiles: free access, registered user, and administrator.
2. Free access users can register, log in, and receive random clothing suggestions for the day.
3. Registered users can log in, receive personalized clothing suggestions based on various factors, and edit their personal data, except for the username.
4. Administrators can log in and perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for different clothing items, such as t-shirts, pants, boots, etc.
5. Implementation of a recommendation algorithm that takes into account the user's gender, current temperature, and weather conditions to suggest suitable clothing for the day.
6. Clothing suggestions should include items for different body parts, such as head, torso, legs, and footwear.

Additionally, there are non-functional requirements, such as the implementation of an API to obtain weather information.
